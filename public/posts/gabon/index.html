<h2 id="about-gabon">About Gabon</h2>
<p>Gabon [ɡabɔ̃], officially called the Gabonese Republic, République Gabonaise, is a french speaking country Located on the equator, west Africa with an are of approx 270,000 km2. It is bordered by Equatorial Guinea to the northwest, Cameroon to the north, the Republic of the Congo on the east and south, and the Gulf of Guinea to the west. Population is estimated at 2.1 million people. Its capital and largest city is Libreville. Since its independence from France in 1960, the sovereign state of Gabon has had three presidents.</p>
<p>The president of Gabon is Ali Bongo Ondimba. The Time zone	UTC+1 (WAT) and the Driving side is on the right. The Calling code  is +241 and Internet TLD is .ga which sounds really cool.</p>
<h2 id="finance">Finance</h2>
<p>The Central African CFA franc (French: franc CFA or simply franc, ISO 4217 code: XAF) is the currency of six independent states in Central Africa: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. These six countries have a combined population of 55.2 million people (as of 2020),and a combined GDP of US$113.322 billion (as of 2020).</p>
<p>CFA stands for Coopération financière en Afrique centrale (&ldquo;Financial Cooperation in Central Africa&rdquo;). It is issued by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC; Banque des États de l&rsquo;Afrique Centrale), located in Yaoundé, Cameroon, for the members of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC; Communauté Économique et Monétaire de l&rsquo;Afrique Centrale). The franc is nominally subdivided into 100 centimes but no centime denominations have been issued.</p>
