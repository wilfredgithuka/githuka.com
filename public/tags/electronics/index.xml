      <description>The ExGNU Radio project is a skilling-up practical project to improve my soldering skills. Its a simple to complex kind of project which starts out simple and ends up being more complex as I dive deeper.

Its an advancement from liner power supplies and this technology has seen wall chargers get smaller and more efficient.
