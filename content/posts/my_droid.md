Hey there my avid reader, how are you? You are probably reading this article
on an Android Device which you at least know very little about whats going on
inside there. Am in the same boat as you, but rowing in different waters. 

Dont you think that our personal devices are becoming increasingly complex? 
Of course as more and more tasks become done on the mobile phone many could justify 
this, but as we become more and more internet-of-humans our devices are becoming too 
sophisticated.

I feel they have overtaken us interms of usage and even when we do not use them,
they are still quetly performing tasks which never seem to end. The devices
are no longer ours but remain the property of what service you have subsribed to
which can at will push notifications, run tasks at the expense of our valuable
batteries.

I want my droid back. Do you get me?

phones to stunning tablets, Android powers them all. Android is a mobile operating 
system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel and other open source
