Blender is awesome :-)

## What is Blender?

Blender is the free and open source 3D creation suite. It supports the entirety of the 
3D pipeline—modeling, rigging, animation, simulation, rendering, compositing and motion 
tracking, even video editing and game creation. Advanced users employ Blender’s API for 
Python scripting to customize the application and write specialized tools; often these 
are included in Blender’s future releases. Blender is well suited to individuals and small 
studios who benefit from its unified pipeline and responsive development process.
