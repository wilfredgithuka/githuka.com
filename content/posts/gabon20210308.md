Ever since I came to Gabon I started a morning workout plan of running
5 laps around the running track in the new stadium. During last week
I was not strict but this week I plan on running 5 laps in the mornings
which will total out to 7x5=35 laps this week.

It takes quite alot of muscle to run and because this is something
that my musles are not used to, the pain after the run can be somewhat hell.

Today as I was running I got interested to know how the muscles behave
when one is running, this image sums it all

Because running is an aerobic and cardio sport, the exercise requires blood to 
travel and pump through the heart at larger and faster rates. As larger quantities 
of blood travel through your body, certain muscles and vessels like the ventricle will 
adapt to the heavier flow of blood and gradually strengthen and expand. The larger 
space can now hold and release more blood. This explains why runners typically are 
not likely to have high blood pressure, blood clots, etc.

Have a goodnight, won't you?
