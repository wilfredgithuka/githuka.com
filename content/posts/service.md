Its about time my car went to the regular service. Every time I gaze at the
digital odometer I see its aproaching the 150,000km mark which is when am 
supposed to take it for service.

However, this time round, things shall be different. I will do the service myself.
Before it has always been done by my mechanic but this time round, I will
meticuilosly change the oil, air filter and oil filter. Its really my first time
doing this so I have to plan well. One of the challenges is getting a place where
I can have access to the vehicle underside. 

The service plan is divided into 3 parts:

* Tooling Up
* Oil Change
* Air Filter Change
* Oil Filter Change

In order to make sure that I get the correct spare parts, I have to carry the
orginal part i.e: The Oil and Air filters. These two I have to carry them to
the garage shops in order not to make a mistake.

I hope to save some cash in this process and learn a thing or two for the future.

## Tooling Up

## Oil Change

## Air-FIlter Change

## Oil Filter Change
