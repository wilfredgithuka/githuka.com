This ride was initially supposed to take me to Mai Mahiu junction in Ndeiya
but I cut it short due to time constraints. The loop starts in Kikuyu on
the Southern Bypass until the Dagoretti Road Interchange where I took Dagoretti
Road all the way to Kamangu Area. Kamangu area adjacent to Maasai plain is quite 
scenic with undulating hills and valleys. It is a famous rock climbing venue.

I noticed a significant decent from Kikuyu since the bike was going downhill
most of the time. I am sure if I am to hit this loop going in reverse, It will
be quite tough.
