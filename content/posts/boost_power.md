One of the main challenges when working with in-car devices is a consistent power
source for most electronics. The Carputer's power is 19V drawing 3.4A which totals
at 64.6W.

I got this nifty little 150W DC-DC Boost converter which takes an input of 12V and converts
it to 19V for the Carputer's input. The operation is quiet without any hum.

In simple terms a DC-to-DC power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping down current) from its input (supply) to its output (load). It is a class of switched-mode power supply (SMPS) containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor) and at least one energy storage element: a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors (sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter).

The output current is always lower than the source current because of P=IV where P is power, I is current and V is voltage.

It has the following features:

* Non-isolated step-up module (BOOST)
* Size: 65mmx56.5mmx23mm
* Input voltage :10-32V
* Output voltage: 12-35V (adjustable)
* Output Current: 6A (MAX)
* Input Current: 10A (MAX) (Please enhance heat dissipation if more than 10A)
* Output power: natural cooling 100W (MAX), enhance heat dissipation 150W (MAX)
* Easy to drive 65W 90W dual-core notebook.
* From a 12V car battery - It can power a 19V 3.42A notebook, the module temperature about 45c
* Conversion efficiency: 94% (measured at Input 16V, output 19V 2.5A)
* Output Ripple: 2% (MAX) 20M-bandwidth
* Operating Temperature: Industrial (-40c to +85c) (ambient temperature exceeds 40c, lower power use, or to enhance heat dissipation)
* Full load temperature rise: 45c
* No-load current: 25mA typical
* Voltage regulation: 0.5%
* Dynamic response speed: 5% 200uS
* Short circuit protection: None (Please Install fuses and protection circuits at Input port.)
* Input Reverse Polarity Protection: None (Please Series diode at the input port.)Some Applications:
