Of late I have been keeping some animals at the farm while trying to grow
plants on the side. The latter has not been so successful due to water issues
which have partly been brought about by power issues. Thats quite a handful of
issues to solve.

At the farm I have a domestic single phase power supply of 240V 50Hz. With no
battery of solar power backup system, remains to be my only source of power. It
is by no means reliable. There are times when there will be no power for 3 days 
straight. To make matters worse the power lines go through my neighbour's trees
before arriving at the farm. We are at the end of the line per say. As you may have
guessed, when it rains with strong wind, the trees glady sway with the lines which
results in a short circuit and thats a blackout for the later part of the day.

I have decided inorder to solve this issues I have to solve the power issue first,
which included re-doing the wiring first.
