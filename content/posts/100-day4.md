Todays ride was on the Western Bypass which starts at Kikuyu and ends at the Ndenderu Junction. The highway
is still under construction and therefore in some sections the dust can be too much on the eyes. This road is 
very wide but just as other bypasses, cycle lanes are unprotected and unmarked. Various paved sections are closed
off to vehicles which is a cyclist paradise.

When cycling on this road one has to be very careful since paved surfaces end abruptly and speed bumps
can be hell to the bike. Other than that its a great place to ride your bike.

Kikuyu is higher in altitude so the trip back from Ndenderu was quite tedious. Its a gradual rise in
steepness which was quite unbearable as I was nearing Kikuyu.

Tomorrow I plan to ride upto Limuru.

Have a peaceful night, won't you?
