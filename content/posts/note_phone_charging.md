One of the biggest issues I have when driving is plugging in my Android
device only to find out later that it was not charging enough or even worse
it was not charging at all. This can be due to a faulty charger or the current
delivered is not enough.

Am planing to design a charging startion that will be put next to the gear on
the lower compartment and will have atleast 4 USB Ports namely:

* Android Fast Charge USB
* Apple Iphone compatible USB 
* Normal USB Port(Future USE)
* Audio USB Connected to Radio

The USB ports will have an LED Feedback when charging is underway and also have
a mater ammeter and voltmeter to indicate values during usage. I also plan to 
add a master switch to turn it off when not in use.

The charging station will be supplied with 12V from the cigarette lighter and
maximum current drawn should not exceed 2A.
