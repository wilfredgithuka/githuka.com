Today afternoon I rode uphill towards Limuru town. I knew that this would be uphill
but the gradient was quite smooth. The highway is also under-construction but the
pavement on this road is concrete.

Despite the highway being quite wide, there was some parts where I had close encounters
with traffic. There are no lane lines and diversions are present.

Safety is highly encouraged for anyone wishing to cycle on this highway.

Have a Good weekend :-)
