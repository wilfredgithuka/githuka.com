The average temperature in Gabon is 30 degrees centigrade with highs of 31 and lows of
24 degrees centigrade. 

The heat here has caused me to drink upto 5 times the amount of water I drink back
in Kenya. Its recomemded to drink uptp 6 litres of water per day which may seem 
impractical but this is trully workable.
