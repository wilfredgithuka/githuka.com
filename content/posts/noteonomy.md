## Introduction

The Noteonomy Project is a longterm learning process
about the intereting word of autonomous vehicle systems.
In this project am using a real vehicle - Nissan Note E11 2008
as I start adding deices in it towards converting it into
a connected car. The Nissan Note E11 2008 Model is a 5 door mini MPV hatchback
manufactured by Nissan Japan. A connected car is a term use to describe a 
car that can interface with the internet for exchange of information. It becomes
an IoT (Internt of Things) device. I plan to add devices such as a Raspberry Pi, CAN Bus
reader, Car Wifi etc.

For a car that was made in 2008, it a big task since the Nissan did not envision such 
for the car. The place to start this project is power. Having a reliable power system is a
good foundation for any device that shall be mounted. I plan to have a secondary power system
which will not interfere/drain the car's primary battery.

## Nissan Note E11 Details

## Safety Notices

While working on such a project can be interesting and a good learning process
I however want to stress upon the concept of safety. If you want to attempt what
you've read here, remember to consult the Official Nissan Manual.

### Electrical Safety

* The starting current of the starter can reach upto 120A DC. This is very dangerous.
* Do not shrt circuit the battery terminals.
* Do not leave the car battery at a lower voltage for too long.
* Have a secondary battery to power your peripherals. Leave the primary battery just for starting the engine.
