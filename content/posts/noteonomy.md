## Introduction

A self-driving car, aka anautonomous vehicle, connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV), full self-driving car or driverless car, 
or robo-car or robotic car, is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input.

Manufactusers hav been announcing the arrival of autonomous vehicles since March 2017 with leading companies prediciting that
2020 shall be the golden year for autonomous vehicles. Much of this was projections but not actual deliverables due to
challenges like legal provisions which would hinder this develpment.


The Githuka Noteonomy Project is a longterm learning process about the intereting word of autonomous vehicle systems.
In this project am using a mini rc vehicles, software model vehicles and a real vehicle - Nissan Note E11 2008 as I start adding devices 
in it towards converting it into a connected car. The Nissan Note E11 2008 Model is a 5 door mini MPV hatchback manufactured by Nissan Japan. 

A connected car is a term use to describe a car that can interface with the internet for exchange of information. It becomes
an IoT (Internt of Things) device. I plan to add devices such as a Raspberry Pi, CAN Bus reader, Car Wifi etc.

For a car that was made in 2008, it a big task since the Nissan did not envision such for the car to hold so much devices. The place to start this 
project is power. Having a reliable power system is a good foundation for any device that shall be mounted. I plan to have a secondary power system
which will not interfere/drain the car's primary battery.

This project is divided into the following major categories:

* Noteonomy - These is the main project which focusses on the Nissan Note vehicle related project.

* NoteonomyRC - All projects that revolve around modeling and concepts on small rc vehicles.

* NoteonomyDoc - Projects Documentation Service

## Nissan Note E11 Details

* Make: Nissan Note
* Model: DBA E11
* Engine: HR Type

## Safety Notices

While working on such a project can be interesting and a good learning process
I however want to stress upon the concept of safety. If you want to attempt what
you've read here, remember to consult the Official Nissan Manual.

### Electrical Safety

* The starting current of the starter can reach upto 120A DC. This is very dangerous.
* Do not shrt circuit the battery terminals.
* Do not leave the car battery at a lower voltage for too long.
* Have a secondary battery to power your peripherals. Leave the primary battery just for starting the engine.
