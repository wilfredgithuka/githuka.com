Today was another opportunity to safely leave the site and
tour the Libreville while buying some supplies.

During the many hours we spend moving around, it was clear
that the Gabonese road users do not like their roads marked. This
was in contrast to Kenya where at least most newly paved roads
have some form of lane markings. Here its visible non-existent.

Today I can brag I got a better picture of the ocean than the one
I took last week.

In this picture of a Gabon market, there is a big difference between
the affluent sides of Gabon and the noisy and often overcrowded areas
like these.

According to the World Bank,Gabon has one of the highest urbanization rates in Africa,
more than 4 in 5 Gabonese citizens live in cities. The capital, Libreville, and 
Port Gentil—the economic capital of the country—are home to 59% of the population.

Gabon is an upper-middle-income country. The fifth largest oil producer in Africa, 
it has had strong economic growth over the past decade, driven by its production of oil 
and manganese. The oil sector has accounted for 80% of exports, 45% of GDP, and 60% of 
fiscal revenue on average over the past five years. However, as the country is facing 
a decline in its oil reserves, the Gabonese government has decided to diversify its economy.

I saw this shipping container designed house on the highway and couldn't help admiring
the ingenuity. Such Ideas have been done elsewhere and this was remarkable.
