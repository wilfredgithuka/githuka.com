This is Day 2 of my stay in Gabon, still going through the mandated quarantine and at the same time
keeping myself busy learning some french. Yesterday I had started the Pimselur French series which I found
to be quite effective but today I didnt touch it which means tomorrow I shall have alot to do.

Interestingly it’s now possible to speak and understand a foreign language effortlessly. Using the world-famous 
Pimsleur Method™ which combines well-established research, most-useful vocabulary and a completely intuitive 
process to get you speaking right from the first day. More on that is avalilable here...

Apart from the daily routine tasks, checking up with frieds to stay sane, today I decided to do a reserch piece
on Mobile communications in Gabon to understand more about my carrier - Gabon Telecom.

Gabon Telecom SA is the largest telecom company in Gabon. The company manages the country's country code top-level domain, .ga.
It operates about 35,000 land lines, and its cellular phone service subsidiary, Libertis has 200,000 customers.
